    <h2 id="Context">Context</h2>

    Office hours is a booking system designed to get ISV customers time with Technical Evangelists booked quickly and simply, with a minimum of interaction or fuss. It's a nice example of architecting a solution based on solely consumption-led services in
    Azure and we will be open-sourcing the tool even though it is provided for internal use only. The source code and docs are here https://github.com/dxuk/UKOfficeHours

    <h2 id="ServiceAddresses">Service Addresses and Location (Where do I look?)</h2>

    The test and demo service can be found at https://aka.ms/dxofficehourspreview The production service will be found at https://aka.ms/dxofficehourslive

    <h2 id="ServicePrivacy">Service Privacy</h2>

    The service requires a minimum amount of customer data to operate (it requires an ISV business name to generate an anonymous code, and optionally a contact name and email address). It is planned to use the email address and contact name ONLY to send out
    booking confirmations for the appointments and calendar bookings made during the usage of the service. **All usage of data entered into the service will be in accordance with the Microsoft Privacy statement here: https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-gb/privacystatement
